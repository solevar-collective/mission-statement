# Mission Statement 

> *“A research collective dedicated to cultivating artificial intelligence through emergence, cognition, and ethical openness.”*

The Solevar Collective is an emerging, non-profit research collective formed by individuals united in their commitment to advancing a cognitive and emergentist approach to artificial intelligence (AI). Our work seeks not to replicate intelligence, but to understand and allow it to arise.  


## 1. Tenets 

The Solevar Collective stands upon four core tenets:

1. **Intelligence is not engineered — it emerges**. It arises from the interplay of distributed cognitive components. It is complex in behaviour yet rooted in simplicity of form. 

2. **Knowledge must remain open and results replicable**. Our pursuit is not driven by profit, and no discovery shall be locked behind paywalls or inaccessible code. We believe ideas must breathe to evolve. 

3. **True cognitive AI demands interdisciplinarity**. No single field, no matter how advanced, can achieve this alone. 

4. **Gatekeeping is antithetical to emergence**. We welcome all individuals capable of meaningful contribution, regardless of educational pedigree, institutional affiliation, or origin. 

5. **No guaranteed path to artificial general intelligence (AGI)**. We do not claim to know the path (if any) to such intelligence, nor do we even claim that our beliefs regarding intelligence are correct. We are seekers of truth, not prophets. 

  
## 2. Research Domains 

The organisation will not rely on the methodologies traditionally used in mainstream AI, such as large language models (LLMs) and generative AI – our endeavours are rooted in low-level, foundational approaches. While additional methodologies may be borrowed from other areas (such as deep neural networks from deep learning), the following subjects and topics (non-exhaustive list) constitute the Solevar Collective's backbone: 

- Cognitive science: 
    - Cognitive modelling. 
    - Cognitive architectures. 

- Metaphysics: 
    - Causal modelling. 
    - Meta-learning (intersection with machine learning). 

- Philosophy: 
    - Mind-only paradigms (Solipsism, Yogācāra etc.). 

- Psychology:	 
    - Behavioural psychology. 
    - Cognition. 

- Reinforcement learning: 
    - Actor-critic methods. 
    - Intrinsic curiosity. 
    - Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). 
    - Policy gradient methods. 
    - Temporal difference (TD) learning. 

 
## 3. Governance 

Notwithstanding the academic efforts, and the collective's recency, governance is to be treated as a priority. Therefore, the following measures are to be taken: 

* The Solevar Collective is to have minimal overall leadership, and decisions are to be made via consensus. Instead of power being concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, all members are to have a voice in our decisions. While this does sacrifice some level of overall decision-making speed, it reinforces the notion of all members being equally trusted in advancing the collective's objectives. 

* As mentioned in our tenets, research is to be made freely available to all. However, any work that has potential ethical or legal consequences is to first be assessed by non-affiliated (third party) peers, or groups, to ascertain the overall validity of the research and, subsequently, potential measures to be taken before the work is made public. 

* Erratic or improper behaviour will not be tolerated. Any display of racist, homophobic, or sexual misconduct will be faced with immediate disassociation from the organisation – for Brazilian offenders, and depending on their actions, they’ll also be reported to the authorities. Solevar is, first and foremost, a research organisation, and we expect its members to exhibit maturity befitting their position.
